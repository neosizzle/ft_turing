This folder contains scripts to generate the UTM machine and the encoded input. Feel free to try out

build a UTM based on json :
`python3 scripts/utm-builder.py <path_to_valid_machine.json>`

encode a machine and its input:
` python3 scripts/compiler.py <path_to_valid_machine.json> <valid_input>`

> The scripts does not check for invalid input and will crash
